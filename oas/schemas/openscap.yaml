  tailoring:
    description: |-
      An optional OpenSCAP tailoring information. Can be done via profile selection or tailoring JSON file.

      In case of profile selection, a tailoring file with a new tailoring profile ID is created and saved to the image. The new tailoring profile ID is created by appending the _osbuild_tailoring suffix to the base profile. For example, given tailoring options for the cis profile, tailoring profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_osbuild_tailoring will be created. The default namespace of the rules is org.ssgproject.content, so the prefix may be omitted for rules under this namespace, i.e. org.ssgproject.content_grub2_password and grub2_password are functionally equivalent. The generated tailoring file is saved to the image as /usr/share/xml/osbuild-oscap-tailoring/tailoring.xml or, for newer releases, in the /oscap_data directory, this is the location used for other OpenSCAP related artifacts.

      It is also possible to use JSON tailoring. In that case, custom JSON file must be provided using the blueprint and used in json_filepath field alongside with json_profile_id field. The generated XML tailoring file is saved to the image as /oscap_data/tailoring.xml.
