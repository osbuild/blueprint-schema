      Configure the repository for dnf on the created image. Enabled by default.

      A repository will be saved as /etc/yum.repos.d/repository-id and enabled so when the image is
      booted, the repository will be available for dnf. This is useful for third-party repositories
      that are not part of the base image.

      When this flag is disabled, the repository will be saved but not enabled.
