  Disk partitioning details. Not available for installer-based images.

  General principles:

  1. All sizes, whether for specific filesystems, partitions, logical volumes,
  or the image itself, are treated as minimum requirements. This means the full
  disk image size is always larger than the size of the sum of the partitions,
  due to requirements for headers and metadata.

  2. The partition that contains the root filesystem, whether this is a plain
  formatted partition, an LVM Volume Group, or a Btrfs partition, is always last
  in the partition table layout when it is automatically added. For Disk
  customizations the user-defined order is respected.

  3. In the case of raw partitioning (no LVM and no Btrfs), the partition
  containing the root filesystem is grown to fill any left over space on the
  partition table. Logical Volumes are not grown to fill the space in the Volume
  Group since they are trivial to grow on a live system.

      Minimum size of the storage device. When not set, the image size is acquired
      from image request.

      Size must be formatted as an integer followed by whitespace and then either
      a decimal unit (B, KB/kB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB) or binary unit (KiB, MiB, GiB,
      TiB, PiB, EiB).
