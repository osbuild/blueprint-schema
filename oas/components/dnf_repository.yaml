  gpg_check_repo:
    description: Enable GPG check for the repository metadata. Disabled by default.
      This is different from gpg_check, which is for the packages.

      This is useful for third-party repositories that do not provide
      GPG keys for the repository metadata.

  gpg_keys:

      GPG keys for the repository.

      The blueprint accepts both inline GPG keys and GPG key urls. If an inline GPG key is provided it
      will be saved to the /etc/pki/rpm-gpg directory and will be referenced accordingly in the repository
      configuration. GPG keys are not imported to the RPM database and will only be imported when first
      installing a package from the third-party repository.
