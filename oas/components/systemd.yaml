  Systemd unit configuration.

  This section can be used to control which services are enabled at boot time.
  Some image types already have services enabled or disabled in order for the image
  to work correctly, and cannot be overridden. For example, ami image type requires
  sshd, chronyd, and cloud-init services. Blueprint services do not replace these
  services, but add them to the list of services already present in the templates,
  if any.
