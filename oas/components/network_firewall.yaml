    description: |
      Services to enable or disable. The service can be defined via an assigned
      IANA name, port number or port range.

      Services are processed in order, when a service is disabled and then accidentally
      enabled via a port or a port range, the service will be enabled in the end.

      By default the firewall blocks all access, except for services that enable their
      ports explicitly such as the sshd.
