  DNF package managers details. When using virtual provides as the
  package name the version glob should be *. And be aware that you will be unable
  to freeze the blueprint. This is because the provides will expand into multiple
  packages with their own names and versions.

  groups:
    description: |
      Groups to install, must match exactly. Groups describes groups
      of packages to be installed into the image. Package groups are defined
      in the repository metadata. Each group has a descriptive name used primarily
      for display in user interfaces and an ID more commonly used in kickstart
      files. Here, the ID is the expected way of listing a group. Groups have
      three different ways of categorizing their packages: mandatory, default,
      and optional. For the purposes of blueprints, only mandatory and default
      packages will be installed. There is no mechanism for selecting optional
      packages.

      as @group_name to install all packages in the group.
