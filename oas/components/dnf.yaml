# BUG IS IN THIS FILE SOMEWHERE
type: object
description: |
  DNF package managers details. When using virtual provides as the
  package name the version glob should be *. And be aware that you will be unable
  to freeze the blueprint. This is because the provides will expand into multiple
  packages with their own names and versions.

  groups:
    description: |
      Groups to install, must match exactly. Groups describes groups
      of packages to be installed into the image. Package groups are defined
      in the repository metadata. Each group has a descriptive name used primarily
      for display in user interfaces and an ID more commonly used in kickstart
      files. Here, the ID is the expected way of listing a group. Groups have
      three different ways of categorizing their packages: mandatory, default,
      and optional. For the purposes of blueprints, only mandatory and default
      packages will be installed. There is no mechanism for selecting optional
      packages.

    description: Modules to enable or disable. This field only supports native DNF
      module names, not the full module stream name. For example, to enable the
      'nodejs' module, use 'nodejs' as the value. To enable a specific stream,
      use 'nodejs:20'.

      Software Collections (SCL) modules must be enabled via the packages field.

  packages:

      Packages to install. Package name or NVRA is accepted as long
      as DNF can resolve it. Examples: vim-enhanced, vim-enhanced-9.1.866-1
      or vim-enhanced-9.1.866-1.fc41.x86_64. The packages can also be specified
      as @group_name to install all packages in the group.

      Software Collections (SCL) modules can be enabled via this field. For native DNF
      modules, use the modules field instead.
