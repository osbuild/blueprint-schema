        of packages to be installed into the image. Package groups are defined
        in the repository metadata. Each group has a descriptive name used primarily
        for display in user interfaces and an ID more commonly used in kickstart
        files. Here, the ID is the expected way of listing a group. Groups have
        three different ways of categorizing their packages: mandatory, default,
        and optional. For the purposes of blueprints, only mandatory and default
        packages will be installed. There is no mechanism for selecting optional
        packages.'
