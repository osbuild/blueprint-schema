        Services to enable or disable. The service can be defined via an assigned IANA name, port number or port range.

        Services are processed in order, when a service is disabled and then accidentally enabled via a port or a port range, the service will be enabled in the end.

        By default the firewall blocks all access, except for services that enable their ports explicitly such as the sshd.
